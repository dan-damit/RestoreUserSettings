# Restore Workstation Data
- This is a companion app to the BackupWorkstation app. The purpose is to restore the local profile data and a few regKeys from the HKCU hive that were copied and exported during Workstation Backup.

- [Latest Release](https://github.com/dan-damit/RestoreWorkstation/releases/latest)

### This restore app is strictly focused on:
- Importing a few HKCU registry settings from the old workstation
- Rehydrating shell tweaks, app preferences, or UI layout
- Restoring local-only artifacts (e.g. browser settings, pinned items)
- Restoring local-only profile data files
