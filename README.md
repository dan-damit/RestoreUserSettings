This is a companion app to the BackupWorkstation app. The purpose is to restore the HKCU hive that was exported during Workstation Backup.

This restore app is strictly focused on:
- Importing HKCU registry settings
- Rehydrating shell tweaks, app preferences, or UI layout
- Restoring local-only artifacts (e.g. browser settings, pinned items)
